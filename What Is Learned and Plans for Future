I am curious by nature. Thus, I experimented with app architecture and structured the app around its features.
As the number of files grew, it was getting harder to keep everything organized. This lead to the conclusion that MVC
is more convinient and easier to use.

Since I didn't implement MVC pattern, sharing data between view controlers wasn't very good structured. I used singleton 
classes to share the user data and the data about the book that is currently read. Lot of bugs could be avoided if the MVC was
used instead.

There are many ways to upgrade this app.

Firstly, it would be really neet to connect app with iBooks if it is possible. That way users could read their own books.

Secondly, the testing user's reading speed feature should be built around Core Data instead of reading the data from files.
This would give user a range of possible texts to read and then answer questions about them. 

Lastly, the users would perhaps like to get the book recommendation and this could be easily done if we had access to their 
Goodreads profile.
